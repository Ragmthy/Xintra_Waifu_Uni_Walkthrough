# XINTRA LABS 
Creating a Repository of Walkthroughs for Labs created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 
Each lab emulates an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) incident

The goal of the repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each lab. 
Full innovation credits for these labs to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective [contributors](https://www.xintra.org/labs#:~:text=BEHIND%20THE%20LAB-,Lab%20Contributors,-Each%20lab%20is).
