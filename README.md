# Xintra_Labs
Creating a Repository of Walkthroughs for Labs created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/)

The goal of the repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each lab. 
Full innovation credits for these labs to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective contributors. 

More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs)
