# XINTRA LABS (Waifu University)
Creating a Repository of Walkthrough for Waifu Lab created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 
Each lab emulates an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) incident

The goal of the repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each section of this Waifu University lab. 
Full innovation credits for this lab goes to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective [contributors](https://www.xintra.org/labs#:~:text=BEHIND%20THE%20LAB-,Lab%20Contributors,-Each%20lab%20is). 

More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs).

### Breakdown of the Repo:
I've uploaded the walkthrough in 2 forms: 
- For those who'd like to read the entire walkthrough as one [singular scroll](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough/tree/main/Complete%20Walkthrough) üìú
  
- For those who'd like to read it part by part as the [lab's network breakdown](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough/tree/main/Part%201.%20Network%20Diagram) and [the lab's respective sections](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough/tree/main/Part%202.%20Lab%20Walkthrough) üï∏Ô∏èüìë

### Mini Reflection of the Waifu Lab
It's one rewarding lab to pursue! It's the first lab I've tried of the XINTRA team's, and it's an incredible, practical resource to try to hone threat-hunting and DFIR skills. I cannot recommend this enough, and although this might be categorized as an easier lab, do not be fooled. But the minute you're able to piece the sequence of events together, it'll be incredibly rewarding. üèÜ
